### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, a backend developer with a graphic design background.

My main foucs is on website projects, usually using Laravel, Blade, Livewire, Tailwind and Alpine. I've contriuted to several open source laravel packagages and php API integrations. With my design background I've also got some JSX scripts for Adobe Indesign, Illustrator and After Effects for use or as an archived reference.

Outside of programing I'm keen on photography and enjoy comedy and writing my own jokes. I have several projects around joke writing, cartoon and joke archives and comedic words and phrases, so message me on mastodon [@hennell](https://phpc.social/@hennell) if you're intrested in the same!
