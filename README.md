### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, a self taught developer with a graphic design background.

I'm mostly using Laravel and PHP for website ideas, but also have some scripts for Adobe Indesign, Illustrator, After Effects etc where they were useful enough to share.

Currently working on various personal sites, mostly around my love of comedy and writing jokes. Message me on twitter @hennell_dev if you're intrested in the same!
